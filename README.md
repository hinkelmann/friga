Friga
=============

Friga is an open-source platform dedicated to the management of academic selection processes, providing control over the entire selection cycle, from the registration phase to the homologation of the final classification. The platform was launched in 2018 when it was first applied in the unified selection of Capes scholarship recipients to serve as teaching assistants at the Universidade Aberta do Brasil (UAB) in hub cities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

Currently, the platform is developed and managed by the Educational Technology Coordination of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) and is hosted at: https://processoseletivo.nte.ufsm.br/.


A Friga has a public area where announcements and disclosures are made regarding:

* Opening notices;
* Edital corrections (Erratas);
* Lists of candidates' classification and scores;
* Lists of submitted appeals with their status (approved or denied);
* Other public information.


The latest version is Friga 2.0.0.87.  You can install Friga on Debian 11 using script: [install.sh](https://github.com/hinkelmann/friga/blob/master/INSTALL.sh).
